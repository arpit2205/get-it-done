# Get It Done
### Get it done is a lot more than just a "ToDo App". Built using HTML, SASS and JS, this to-do list app has features like : displaying a log of total number of tasks as well as completed tasks, a log of recently completed tasks along with their date of completion, a reset option to clear all tasks and two theme options light & dark. Also, to make this app usable in real life, I have used IndexedDB (LocalStorage API) to save all the tasks, task logs and theme choices temporarily in a device's browser memory. So even if you refresh the app, all your data remains saved!
